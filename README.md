# Play-Game-on-windsurf

## About the Project

Arcade Games Catalog is an interactive catalog of mini arcade games, directly accessible in the browser. It features:
- An intuitive and responsive user interface (categories, filters, dynamic buttons)
- Filters by game type (Action, Puzzle, Platformer, Shooter, Racing)
- A dynamic loading module, allowing games to be displayed from a file
- A simple navigation system: clicking “Play” gives immediate access to the selected game

The goal is to centralize a collection of games in a single interface, making them easy to explore and launch.
